# Weather Report App

## Description
This app provides a quick weather report.  This project was the first coding an API to return data.  In this case, a city geolocation is searched with a weather api, returning a stack of raw data that is then processed.  The processing yields key weather metrics, which are displayed on the page, along with an extended forecast.  Searches are stored locally and appear at the bottom of the page.
